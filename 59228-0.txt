THE REVOLT OF THE ANGELS
By Anatole France
A Translation By Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson
CHAPTER I	Containing in a few lines the history of a French family from 1789 to the present day
CHAPTER II	Wherein useful information will be found concerning a library where strange things will shortly come to pass
CHAPTER III	Wherein the mystery begins
CHAPTER IV	Which in its forceful brevity projects us to the limits of the actual world
CHAPTER V	Wherein everything seems strange because everything is logical
CHAPTER VI	Wherein P�re sariette discovers his missing treasures
CHAPTER VII	Of a somewhat lively interest, whereof the moral will, I hope, appeal greatly to my readers
CHAPTER VIII	Which speaks of love, a subject which always gives pleasure, for a tale without love is like beef without mustard: an insipid dish
CHAPTER IX	Wherein it is shown that, as an ancient Greek poet said, "nothing is sweeter than Aphrodite the Golden"
CHAPTER X	Which far surpasses in audacity the imaginative flights of Dante and Milton
CHAPTER XI	Recounts in what manner the angel, attired in the cast-off garments of a suicide, leaves the youthful Maurice without a heavenly guardian
CHAPTER XII	Wherein it is set forth how the angel Mirar, when bearing grace and consolation to those dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Champs �lys�es in Paris, beheld a music-hall singer named Bouchotte and fell in love with her
CHAPTER XIII	Wherein we hear the beautiful archangel Zita unfold her lofty designs and are shown the wings of mirar, all moth-eaten, in a cupboard
CHAPTER XIV	Which reveals the cherub toiling for the welfare of humanity and concludes in an entirely novel manner with the miracle of the flute
CHAPTER XV	Wherein we see young Maurice bewailing the loss of his guardian angel, even in his mistress's arms, and wherein we hear the Abb� Patouille reject as vain and illusory all notions of a new rebellion of the angels
CHAPTER XVI	Wherein Mira the seeress, Z�phyrine, and the fatal Am�d�e are successively brought upon the scene, and wherein the notion of Euripides that those whom Zeus wishes to crush he first makes mad, is illustrated by the terrible example of Monsieur Sariette
CHAPTER XVII	Wherein we learn that Sophar, no less eager for gold than mammon, looked upon his heavenly home less favourably than upon France, a country blessed with a savings bank and loan departments, and wherein we see, yet once again, that whoso is possessed of this world's goods fears the evil effects of any change
CHAPTER XVIII	Wherein is begun the gardener's story, in the course of which we shall see the destiny of the world unfolded in a discourse as broad and magnificent in its views as Bossuet's discourse on the history of the universe is narrow and dismal
CHAPTER XIX	The gardener's story, continued
CHAPTER XX	The gardener's story, continued
CHAPTER XXI	The gardener's story, concluded
CHAPTER XXII	Wherein we are shown the interior of a bric-a-brac shop, and see how P�re Guinardon's guilty happiness is marred by the jealousy of a love-lorn dame
CHAPTER XXIII	Wherein we are permitted to observe the admirable character of Bouchotte, who resists violence but yields to love. After that let no one call the author a misogynist
CHAPTER XXIV	Containing an account of the vicissitudes that befel the "Lucretius" of the Prior de Vend�me
CHAPTER XXV	Wherein Maurice finds his angel again
CHAPTER XXVI	The Conclave
CHAPTER XXVII	Wherein we shall see revealed a dark and secret mystery and learn how it comes about that empires are often hurled against empires, and ruin falls alike upon the victors and the vanquished; and the wise reader (if such there be-which I doubt) will meditate upon this important utterance: "a war is a matter of business"
CHAPTER XXVIII	Which treats of a painful domestic scene
CHAPTER XXIX	Wherein we see how the angel, having become a man, behaves like a man, coveting another's wife and betraying his friend. in this chapter the correctness of young d'Esparvieu's conduct will be made manifest
CHAPTER XXX	Which treats of an affair of honour, and which will afford the reader an opportunity of judging whether, as arcade affirms, the experience of our faults makes better men and women of us
CHAPTER XXXI	Wherein we are led to marvel at the readiness with which an honest man of timid and gentle nature can commit a horrible crime
CHAPTER XXXII	Which describes how Nectaire's flute was heard in the tavern of Clodomir
CHAPTER XXXIII	How a dreadful crime plunges Paris into a state of terror
CHAPTER XXXIV	Which contains an account of the arrest of Bouchotte and Maurice, of the disaster which befell the d'Esparvieu library, and of the departure of the angels
CHAPTER XXXV	And last, wherein the sublime dream of Satan is unfolded
